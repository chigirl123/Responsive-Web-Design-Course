* Using HTML 5 Semantic Elements
As you learned in our first class, you begin a new HTML document by adding the basic required HTML elements to it, such as the DOCTYPE, html, head, and body elements. Within the body element, you next add HTML elements that define the structure of the page. HTML 4.01 introduced the div element (with the <div> and </div> tags) to divide a page into separate sections. Each div element usually has a unique id attribute to distinguish it from other div elements on the page. For example, you might use a div element with an id attribute named header for the header area and another div element with an id attribute named nav for the navigation area. However, webpage authors can use any name they like to define a div id attribute, leading to inconsistency among naming conventions for websites. You will learn more about the div element in our next class.

HTML 5 has transformed and improved website development with the introduction of several new semantic elements with standardized names.  The name of each tag reflects the purpose of the element. For instance, you use the footer element to display content at the bottom (or footer) of the webpage. You use the nav element to identify the navigation area of a webpage. Because many of the semantic elements help to structure

Element Description
<header>…</header> 
    - Indicates the header information on the webpage. Header content typically consists of a business name or logo and is commonly positioned immediately after the opening <body> tag.

<nav>…</nav> 
    - Indicates the start and end of a navigation area within the webpage. The nav element contains hyperlinks to other webpages within a website and is commonly positioned immediately after the closing </header> tag.

<main>…</main> 
    - Indicates the start and end of the main content area of a webpage. Contains the primary content of the webpage. Only one main element can appear on a page.

<footer>…</footer> 
    - Indicates the start and end of the footer area of a webpage. Contains the footer content of the webpage.

<section>…</section> 
    - Indicates the start and end of a section area of a webpage. Contains a specific grouping of content on the webpage.

<article>…</article> 
    - Indicates the start and end of an article area of a webpage. Contains content such as forum or blog posts.

<aside>…</aside> 
    - Indicates the start and end of an aside area of a webpage. Contains information about nearby content and is typically displayed as a sidebar.

Professional web designers debate whether to use the div element or the main element to define the main content area of a webpage. Those who favor the div element argue that it has widespread browser support. The W3C introduced the main element after other semantic elements, and not all browsers or text editors recognize it yet.

Web designers who favor the main element do so because main is a semantic element while div is not. In other words, the name of the main element describes its purpose and function. The div element relies on its id attribute to provide meaning.

After discussing the pros and cons of the main and div elements with the owner of the Forward Fitness Club, you decide to use the main element for the fitness website. Because it is a new site that does not have to incorporate webpages created with earlier versions of HTML, it will use the new HTML 5 semantic elements, including header, nav, main, and footer, to lay out the webpages. Although the div element achieves the same results in layout, the future of web development includes using the new HTML 5 layout tags, and Forward Fitness wants to create a foundation for this future. Using the semantic HTML 5 elements standardizes naming conventions, making webpages more universal, accessible, and meaningful to search engines.

* Header Element
The header element structurally defines the header area of a webpage. The header element starts with a <header> tag and ends with a </header> tag. Content placed between these tags appears on the webpage as part of the header element. Web designers often place a business name or logo within the header element.

* Nav Element
The nav element structurally defines the navigation area of a webpage. The nav element starts with a <nav> tag and ends with a </nav> tag. The nav element usually includes links to other pages within the website.

* Main Element
The main element structurally defines the main content area of a webpage. The main element starts with a <main> tag and ends with a </main> tag. Each page can have only one main element because its content should be unique to each page. At the time this book was written, all current major browsers supported the main element, with the exception of Internet Explorer 11 and earlier versions. While Internet Explorer 11 will display content within the main element, it does not fully support the element. For example, Internet Explorer 11 might not correctly display formatting applied to the main element.

* Footer Element
The footer element structurally defines the bottom, or footer area, of a webpage. The footer element starts with a <footer> tag and ends with a </footer> tag. Common content found within a webpage footer includes copyright information, contact information, social media links, and policy links.
