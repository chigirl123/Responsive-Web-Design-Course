* Exploring the Internet
Every day, millions of people use a computer to connect to the Internet. The
Internet is a worldwide collection of computers linked together for use by businesses,
governments, educational institutions, other organizations, and individuals using
modems, phone lines, television cables, satellite links, fiber-optic connections, radio
waves, and other communications devices and media

The Internet was developed in the 1960s by the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). ARPANET (as the Internet was originally called) had only four nodes and sent its first message in 1969. A node is any device, such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone, connected to a network, which is a collection of two or more computers linked together to share resources and information. The Internet has billions of nodes on millions of networks. The Internet of Things is a term used to describe the ever-growing number of devices connecting to a network, including televisions and appliances. Today, high-, medium-, and low-speed data lines connect networks. These data lines allow data (including text, graphical images, audio, and video) to move from one computer to another. The Internet backbone is a collection of high-speed data lines that link major computer systems located around the world. An Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that has a permanent connection to the Internet backbone. ISPs use high- or mediumspeed data lines to allow personal and business computer users to connect to the backbone for access to the Internet. A home Internet connection is generally provided through a cable or fiber-optic line that connects to an ISP.

computers in their homes, offices, schools, and public locations such as libraries. In fact, the Internet was designed to be a place in which people could share information and collaborate. Users with computers connected to the Internet can access a variety of popular services, including email, social networking, and the web.

* World Wide Web
Many people use the terms Internet and World Wide Web interchangeably, but these terms have different meanings. The Internet is the infrastructure, or the physical networks of computers. The World Wide Web, also called the web, is the service that provides access to information stored on web servers, the high-capacity, highperformance computers that power the web. The web consists of a collection of linked files known as webpages, or pages for short. Because the web supports text, graphics, audio, and video, a webpage can display any of these multimedia elements in a browser.

A website, or site for short, is a related collection of webpages created and maintained by a person, company, educational institution, or other organization. Each website contains a home page, which is the main page and the first document users see when they access the website. The home page typically provides information about the website’s purpose and content, often by including a list of links to other webpages on the website.

Hyperlinks are an essential part of the web. A hyperlink, more commonly called a link, is an element that connects one webpage to another webpage on the same server or to any other web server in the world. Tapping or clicking a link allows you to move quickly from one webpage to another without being concerned about where the webpages reside. You can also tap or click links to move to a different section of the same webpage. With zhyperlinks, you do not necessarily have to view information in a linear way. Instead, you can tap or click the available links to view the information in a variety of ways, Many webpage components, including text, graphics, and animations, can serve as links.

* Protocols
A computer is also referred to as a client workstation. Client workstations connect to the Internet through the use of a protocol. A protocol is a set of rules that defines how a client workstation can communicate with a server. A client workstation uses a protocol to request a connection to a server. The server is the host computer that stores resources and files for websites
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the fundamental protocol used on the web to exchange and transfer webpages. HTTP is a set of rules for exchanging text, graphics, audio, video, and other multimedia files on the web. When you tap or click a link on a webpage, your computer uses HTTP to connect to the server containing the page you want to view, and then to request and display the appropriate page.

    - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to exchange files from one computer to another over the Internet (not the web). The sole purpose of FTP is to exchange files; this protocol does not provide a way to view a webpage. Businesses commonly use FTP to exchange files with vendors and suppliers. Web designers often use FTP to transfer updated website content to a web hosting server, the computer that stores webpages and other related content for a website.

    - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a pair of protocols used to transfer data efficiently over the Internet by properly routing it to its destination. TCP oversees the network connection between the data source and destination and micromanages the data. When data is sent over the Internet, TCP breaks the data into packets. Each packet contains addressing information, which the IP manages. One way to better understand TCP/IP is through an analogy of the postal system. The tasks TCP performs are similar to those workers or machines perform when handling a bundle of packages in a post office. In this analogy, the packages are addressed to one destination, but are too large to send as a single bundle. TCP breaks up the bundle into manageable pieces and then sends them out for delivery. When each piece arrives at the destination, TCP reassembles the bundle of packages.

    - Internet Protocol (IP) ensures data is sent to the correct location. In the postal system analogy, the IP part of TCP/IP refers to the street address and zip code to route a piece of mail. Just as people have a unique mailing address, every client workstation and server on the Internet has a unique IP address. An example of an IP address is 192.168.1.5. Every website has a unique IP address, which makes it easy for computers to find websites. However, most people have difficulty in remembering and using IP addresses to access websites. The Domain Name System (DNS) was created to resolve this issue. The DNS associates an IP address with a domain name. For example, the DNS associates the IP address 204.79.197.200 with the domain name bing.com.

* Web Browsers
To access a website and display a webpage, a computer, tablet, or mobile device must have a web browser. A web browser, also called a browser, is a program that interprets and displays webpages so you can view and interact with them. Computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops include their own default browser, but you also have the option to download and use the browser of your choice. You use a browser to locate websites, to link from one webpage to another, to add a favorite or bookmark a webpage, and to choose security settings.

Besides varying by publisher, browsers vary by version. Most browsers do not display webpages identically. In fact, older versions of some browsers do not support the most recent HTML 5 standards. As you are designing your website, you must view it using various browsers to ensure that it looks and functions as you intended.

A web address, or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), is the address of a document or other file accessible on the Internet and identifies the network location of a website, such as www.w3.org.com. To access a website using a browser, you type the webpage’s URL in the browser’s address bar

The URL www.w3.org indicates to the browser to use the HTTPS communications protocol to locate the membership.html webpage in the Consortium folder on the w3.org server or domain. A domain is an area of the Internet a particular organization or person manages. In this case, w3.org is the name of the domain, with the .org indicating it is registered as a nonprofit organization. The www part of the URL is short for World Wide Web and is a common subdomain used in a URL. The www is not required and can be omitted or replaced with another meaningful name for the subdomain. You can find webpage URLs in a wide range of places, including school catalogs, business cards, product packaging, and advertisements.

* Types of Websites
An Internet site is another term for a website that is generally available to anyone with an Internet connection. Other types of websites include intranets and extranets, which also use Internet technology, but limit access to specified groups. An intranet is a private network that uses Internet technologies to share company information among employees. An intranet is contained within an organization’s network, which makes it private and available only to those who need access. Organizations often distribute documents such as policy and procedure manuals, employee directories, company newsletters, product catalogs, and training manuals on an intranet.

An extranet is a private network that uses Internet technologies to share business information with select corporate partners or key customers. Companies and other organizations can use an extranet to share product manuals, training modules, inventory status, and order information. An extranet might also allow retailers to purchase inventory directly from their suppliers or to pay bills online.

Companies use websites to advertise or sell their products and services worldwide, as well as to provide technical and product support for their customers. Many company websites also support electronic commerce (e-commerce), which is the buying and selling of goods and services on the Internet. Using e-commerce technologies, these websites allow customers to browse product catalogs, compare products and services, and order goods online.

Colleges, universities, and other schools use websites to distribute information about areas of study, provide course information, and register students for classes online. Many educational institutions use a Learning Management System (LMS) to simplify course management. An LMS is a web-based software application designed to facilitate online learning. Instructors use the LMS to communicate announcements, post questions on reading material, list contact information, and provide access to lecture slides and videos. Students use the LMS to find information related to their courses, including project instructions and grades. Many LMS tools allow instructors to write their own webpage content that provides further information for their students.
